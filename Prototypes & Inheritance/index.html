    function iPhone(){} //constructor

    //Features like Face ID, video capabilities, and default apps are added to the iPhone prototype, showcasing inheritance and method creation.
    iPhone.prototype.faceId = function () {
        console.log ("unlock my phone with my face");
    }

    iPhone.prototype.video = function () {
        console.log ("take 4k video with my iPhone");
    }

    iPhone.prototype.stocksApp = function () {
        console.log ("find out what the stock market is doing");
    }

    //create an object called myPhone inheriting features from the iPhone prototype.
    let myPhone = new iPhone();
    myPhone.faceId();
    myPhone.video();
    myPhone.stocksApp();

    myPhone.app= 'instagram';
    console.log(myPhone);

    //You can override inherited properties, i.e upgrading an app on a phone.
    //The prototype allows access to the original function even after overriding it.
 /*    myPhone.stocksApp = function() {
        console.log("upgrade to Pro version")
    } */

    //Managing Properties
        // You can set a property to undefined to effectively remove it, while still retaining the prototype inheritance.
        // The delete method can also be used to remove properties from an object.
    myPhone.stocksApp = undefined;

    console.log(myPhone);

    var myAnimals = ["chicken", "dog", "llama", "turtle"];
    console.log(myAnimals);

    //Notes:
    //The proto property points to the object from which an instance inherits.
    //Arrays in JavaScript inherit methods from the array prototype, allowing access to various array methods like push and splice.
    //Array.prototype.push() is a method that belongs to the array object. (You  can see all the inherited array methods when you inspect an array.)
    //Any array you make has access to array methods because these methods are inherited through the prototype chain.
    //Arrays are a type of object and inherit from the object prototype
    //Example of prototypal inheritance: If you have an object animal with a method speak, and you create a new object dog that inherits from animal, the dog object can use the speak method without having it defined directly on itself.
    


    //Another Example
    //A variable carManufacturer holds an object with features like the manufacturer's name, model, trim level, and base features.
    // A variable dealership is created using Object.create(carManufacturer), inheriting all properties from carManufacturer.

    const carManufacturer = {
        name: "Hyundai",
        model: "Elantra",
        trimLevel: "se",
        baseFeatures: [ "wheels", "engine", "seats"],
        entertainment: "bluetooth audio system"
    }

    const dealership = Object.create(carManufacturer);

    // The dealership can add its own features, such as a roof rack or extended warranty, to the cars it receives from the manufacturer.
    // A new variable myCar is created from the dealership, which can include additional custom features.

    dealership.equipment = "roof rack";
    dealership.warranty = "extended";
    dealership.branding = "license plate frame";

    const myCar = Object.create(dealership);

    myCar.custom = "after market trailer hitch";
    myCar.bumperSticker = "Save the Llamas";
    myCar.entertainment = "fancy audio system";
    
    console.log(myCar.model);
    console.log(myCar.branding);
    console.log(myCar.entertainment);

    //The myCar object inherits properties from both the dealership and the manufacturer, allowing access to all features through the prototypical chain.
    //A for...in loop is introduced to iterate over the properties of the myCar object, displaying both custom and inherited features in order.

    for (const key in myCar){
        if(myCar.hasOwnProperty(key)){
            const val = myCar[key];
        console.log(`key is "${key}" and value is "${val}"`);
        }  
    }

    //Notes:
    // The hasOwnProperty method is a tool that allows developers to check if a property belongs directly to the object.
